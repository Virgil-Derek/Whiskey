This is the README file for the use of Bootstrap delivered by Virgil Derek for Whiskey service page. This was made for the general understanding of bootstrap. 
A previous version was lost because of a the negligence of adding to staging area, commiting and pushing to github.

1. Created index.html with basic header, paragraph and button.
2. Added CDN bootstrap link -> Bootstrap doc. -> download -> version 4.1 -> CDN -> Copy/paste
                  Question: for my project, I want to use the current up to date version of bootstrap. Where can I find the CDN? and should I start with it already in this         project?
4. Updated title in head for new pagesubject.

Created article with 3 sections.
